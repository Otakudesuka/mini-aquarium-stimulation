# mini-aquarium-stimulation

This is a stimulation displaying a bunch of fish models swirming aorund a pillar. They are trained such that it gives a natural feel as if the real fishes are swimming in the water.
Using vector and physics concept, the fishes are trained with algorithms and certain goals.
The pillar is set a center point for them, such that if the distance between a certain fish exceed the distance between that fish and the pillar, it swims back adjusting its linear speed and rotaional speed and finally mixes with the crowd.
